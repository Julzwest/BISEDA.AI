## ⏰ DNS Propagation (15-30 minutes)

**What's happening now:**
- DNS changes are propagating across the internet
- GitHub Pages is checking DNS status
- This usually takes 15-30 minutes

**You can check status:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Julzwest/bisedaai-legal/settings/pages
2. Look at DNS status (should say "in progress" or "failed" initially)
3. After 15-30 min, it should change to "passed"

## ✅ After DNS Propagates

### **Step 1: Verify DNS Status**

1. **Go to:** GitHub Pages settings
2. **Check:** DNS status should say "DNS check passed"
3. **If still "in progress":** Wait a bit longer (up to 1 hour)

### **Step 2: Enable HTTPS**

**Once DNS check passes:**

1. **In GitHub Pages settings**, find "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox
2. **Check:** The checkbox
3. **Wait:** A few minutes for SSL certificate
4. **Done:** Your site will be live at `https://bisedaai.com`
