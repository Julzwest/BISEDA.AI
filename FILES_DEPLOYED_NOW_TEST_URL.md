# ✅ Files Are Deployed! Now Test URLs

## ✅ Good News!

The raw file works, which means:
- ✅ Files are deployed correctly
- ✅ `index.html` exists and has correct content
- ✅ The issue is just the GitHub Pages URL format

---

## 🧪 Test These GitHub Pages URLs

Since your repository name is `BISEDA.AI` (with dots), try these URLs:

### Option 1: Original Format
**Try:** `https://julzwest.github.io/BISEDA.AI/`

### Option 2: URL Encoded Dot
**Try:** `https://julzwest.github.io/BISEDA%2EAI/`
(where %2E is the URL encoding for a dot)

### Option 3: Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. **Go to:** https://github.com/Julzwest/BISEDA.AI/settings/pages
2. **Look for:** "Your site is live at..." section
3. **What URL does it show?** (Copy that exact URL)

## 🎯 Most Likely Solution

GitHub Pages might show you the exact URL in Settings. Check:

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/Julzwest/BISEDA.AI/settings/pages
2. **Look for:** "Your site is live at..." or "Visit site" button
3. **What URL does it show?**

## 🔧 Alternative: Use Custom Domain

Since you have `bisedaai.com`:
1. **Go to:** https://github.com/Julzwest/BISEDA.AI/settings/pages
2. **Custom domain:** Enter `bisedaai.com`
3. **Click:** "Save"
4. **Wait 5-10 minutes**
5. **Test:** `https://bisedaai.com/`
