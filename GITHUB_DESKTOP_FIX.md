# 🔧 GitHub Desktop - Add Repository Manually

## ✅ Alternative Method

Since double-clicking isn't working, let's add it manually:

---

## 🎯 Steps:

### Step 1: Click "Add an Existing Repository"

1. **In GitHub Desktop**, click the button:
   - **"Add an Existing Repository from your Local Drive..."**
   - (It's the 4th button with a folder icon)

### Step 2: Select Your Folder

1. **Navigate to:** `/Users/xhuljongashi/BISEDA.AI`
2. **Click:** "Add repository" button

### Step 3: Publish

After adding, you should see:
- A "Publish repository" button
- Click it to push to GitHub!

## 🎯 Alternative: Use Terminal with Token

If GitHub Desktop still doesn't work, we can use terminal with a personal access token.

**Try clicking "Add an Existing Repository" first!**
