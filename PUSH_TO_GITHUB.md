# 📤 Push Your Code to GitHub

## ✅ Your code is ready, but needs to be on GitHub!

Render can't find your repository because it's not on GitHub yet. Let's fix this!

---

## 🎯 Quick Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `BISEDA.AI` (or `biseda-ai`)
3. **Description:** (optional) "BISEDA.AI - AI Coach Mobile App"
4. **Visibility:** 
   - ✅ **Public** (for free hosting)
   - OR **Private** (if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** check "Add a README" (we have code already)
6. **Click:** "Create repository" (green button)

### Step 2: Push Your Code

**After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:**

```bash
cd /Users/xhuljongashi/BISEDA.AI
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit - BISEDA.AI backend ready for deployment"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Julzwest/BISEDA.AI.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `Julzwest/BISEDA.AI` with your actual username/repo name!**

## 🚀 After Pushing

Once your code is on GitHub:
1. **Go back to Render**
2. **Refresh the search** (or close and reopen the service creation)
3. **Search for:** `BISEDA.AI` or your repo name
4. **Select it** and continue with deployment!

**Let's do this!** Create the repo first, then I'll help you push the code.
