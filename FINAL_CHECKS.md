## 🔍 Now Check Deployment

### Step 1: Check Actions Tab

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/Julzwest/BISEDA.AI/actions
2. **Look at the latest workflow:**
   - ✅ **Green checkmark** = Deployment succeeded! Test your site!
   - ⏳ **Yellow circle** = Still building (wait 2-3 more minutes)
   - ❌ **Red X** = Failed (click it to see error)

**What do you see?**

---

### Step 2: Test GitHub Pages URL

Try: `https://julzwest.github.io/BISEDA.AI/`

**Does it work?**
- ✅ **If YES:** Your site is live! The custom domain (`bisedaai.com`) might need configuration
- ❌ **If NO:** Check the Actions tab for errors

---

### Step 3: If GitHub Pages URL Works But Custom Domain Doesn't

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/Julzwest/BISEDA.AI/settings/pages
2. **Check "Custom domain" section:**
   - Is `bisedaai.com` entered?
   - Is there a green checkmark?
   - Click "Save" if you just added it
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation

## 🎯 Most Likely Next Steps

Since files are correct:
1. **Check Actions tab** - is deployment successful?
2. **Test GitHub Pages URL** - does `https://julzwest.github.io/BISEDA.AI/` work?
3. **If GitHub URL works but custom domain doesn't** - configure custom domain in settings
